<h1 align="center"><b>Hello, I'm Roy Waswa</b></h1>

I am a student at **Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology** in _Nairobi_, Kenya. Currently juggling my studies in Geomatics Engineering and GIS while interning at The Open Institute. You'll usually find me geeking out over **GIS, Remote Sensing, and Data analytics**.

<h2 align="center"><b>What I'm into</b></h2>
I've got quite the skill set, but here's what I'm particularly good at:


| Skill       | Description|
|-------------|------------|
|<img src="./icons/python.svg" height=200 />| I can work wonders with Python, especially when it comes to scripting and automation for Data Analysis, GIS, and Remote Sensing. You name it—Google Earth Engine, PyQGIS, ArcPy—I've got you covered.|
|<img src="./icons/javascript.svg" height=200 /> |When it comes to front-end scripting, I'm your go-to guy for Vanilla, ReactJS, and NextJS. Need some back-end scripting? I've got experience with NodeJS, ExpressJS, and even dabble in Google Earth Engine.|
|<img src="./icons/rstudio.svg" height=200 /> | I dive into R for all things Data Analytics, GIS, and Remote Sensing. It's my trusty sidekick for scripting and automation.|

## **What I'm currently learning**
In the world of technology, staying relevant is directly tied to continuous learning. It's crucial to constantly update your skills and knowledge to avoid being replaced, or worse, left behind by advancements like ChatGPT (which I unashamedly used to spruce up this bio!).

- Data Science and Machine Learning: Big data and AI are the real deal these days. So, I'm all about mastering these fields because, let's face it, I don't want to be replaced by some fancy ChatGPT. It would hurt my feelings, seriously.
- Elixir: I'm digging into server-side scripting using Elixir. It's like adding a new spice to my programming recipe.
- Object-Oriented Programming Design Patterns: Currently, I'm geeking out over Design Patterns for Object-Oriented Programming. It's like unraveling the secrets of building awesome software.

Wow, you've actually made it through all of that! That's pretty impressive. So, as you can see, that's me summed up. I do tend to get chatty, but hey, that just means there's always something to discuss. Feel free to explore my repositories, open issues if you come across anything, or simply shoot me an email. Let's keep the conversation going!
